# CS449_CheckMark
Android project for CS449 / CheckMark by Osama Alhaiki

## Vision Statement

CheckMark is going to be an android application that aims to help and assist the user keep track of all their tasks and stay up to date with everything that revolves around their daily lives. 
Every person has tasks to take care of, whether its work, school, family or anything else but when someones schedule gets hectic it could be difficult to keep track of everything. With CheckMark, the user will be able to input all their tasks and To-Do’s and they will be reminded prior to the event/task as they plan it
For instance, students will be able to log all their assignments with their due date and then choose when to be reminded prior to the deadline and then check it off upon completion. Students will be able to stay up to date with everything that is due and make sure to never miss a deadline again.
For immediate release, the application should be able to store tasks and remind the user on a specific time/date and have the ability to check it off your list. The user can create multiple tasks and set reminders with alerts & notifications.

## Sprint 1
### Review & Restrospective 
In this iteration the main layout and functions of the application were designed and implemented. Home screen was created successfully with the ability to add or CheckMark new tasks and reminders.  
The process started with getting the Android studio environment ready and then creating and building the project. Giving estimates on tasks/stories was hard to determine given that the android application is built using Java as the programming language. I had little knowledge on Java so a majority of the time spent was figuring out how to do things. 
For next iteration I’d research the task needed to be built in order to get more accurate estimates.

## Sprint 2
### Review & Restrospective 
This sprint the goal was to finish building the app ’s functionalities and add the settings page layout. In addition, implementing the feedback process so that the user can send in bug reports or future update ideas. Once the user clicks on “contact us” the page will directed to the users email account with my student email addressed. Also, the ability to adjust the format of the date has been implemented. Given where I come from (middle east) we format the day as D/M/Y rather than M/D/Y. 
In this second iteration, the process was getting smoother as I was getting acquainted with android studio and java environment.  Adding the “feedback” took majority of the time for this iteration as it took multiple tries to get it to work the way I planned it. The users device info is automatically copied to the top of the feedback email to know the source of the issue/bug when reported. For the next iteration, i'll work more on developing the application to enhance the user experience.  

## Sprint 3
### Review & Restrospective 
For the third iteration, the focus was to enhance the usability of the application and finish implementing the assigned stories. On this update, you can turn on/off the animations that were added in the previous build as it was causing issues when tested on an older android OS emulator. To avoid this issues for people on older devices, they can turn it off for a more fluid experience. Also, now the tasks/deadlines added on your CheckMark list will appear on your notification center to keep the user reminded of what’s upcoming.
After adding the animations in the previous iteration, when testing with older OS of android emulators, the application would often crash and exit. This iteration I focused on getting that issue resolved and adding the ability to turn on/off the animations for a better experience. Also, notifications will now appear on the swipe down menu. For the next irritation, the plan is to further develop the application by adding new features. 

## Sprint 4
### Review & Restrospective 
On this fourth iteration, you get welcomed by the recently implemented “Whats New” page that was imported from an open source library (source will be listed in an upcoming iteration update to the ‘settings’ page) As listed, the fourth iteration brings customizability through setting your notification sounds/alerts. Finally, created a widget for the home screen to keep the user up with their tasks.
Here, I used an open source library to bring in the “Whats new” page upon launching the application for either the first time or after an update. The page will list all the changes that had been made. Implementing that took longer than expected but it taught it enhanced my skills in android studio for an easier experience with the upcoming iterations. 

## Sprint 5
### Review & Restrospective 
The fifth iteration aimed to keep moving through the stories as per the plan. There has been slight changes to the UI design.The home page now displays “Theres nothing to worry about!”  To indicate that the list is empty and ‘worry free’. 
To add more personality to the application and it's naming the following commands have been replaced: ’Delete this task’ is now replaced by ‘CheckMark this task’ and it's options from a ‘cancel/delete’ to ‘not yet/get it away’. 
As reported in the previous iteration, the resources used to implement some of the functions of this application are now listed in the ‘settings’ page under ‘Resources’.
By the fifth iteration, most of the planned tasks were completed and the work was focused on resolving bugs/issues and testing the application further to ensure the product is in a shippable state. Here, some minor enhancements have been made to the UI to bring it personality of the brand name “CheckMark”. I have also added a resource page to show any open source libraries for some of the functionality added. For the final iteration, the plan is to finalize everything and ensure the state of the application. 

## Sprint 6
### Review & Restrospective 
On the 6th and final iteration, the user can now backup their list and restore backup files if lost or corrupted.In addition, the ‘about’ banner has been implemented to display the version and also directs the user to the projects library on Github. Most of the work was to test the applications usability and functionality to ensure its a shippable product.
For the final run, the plan was to make sure everything planned was completed and tested. have also added the functionality to backup your list and restore from a backup file if lost. Also, the about page would display the version of the application and when clicked it will redirect the user to the Github project’s link. Most of the time for spent this iteration was for testing all the application’s functionality using different emulators and android operating systems.
