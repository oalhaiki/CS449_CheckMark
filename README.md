# CS449_CheckMark
Android project for CS449 / CheckMark by Osama Alhaiki

## Vision Statement

This is where you put the vision for what your program will do.  It should summarize key features, explain why this will be useful, and discuss what’s planned for immediate release and what’s envisioned for future development (stretch goals). 

CheckMark is going to be an android application that aims to help and assist the user keep track of all their tasks and stay up to date with everything that revolves around their daily lives. 
Every person has tasks to take care of, whether its work, school, family or anything else but when someones schedule gets hectic it could be difficult to keep track of everything. With CheckMark, the user will be able to input all their tasks and To-Do’s and they will be reminded prior to the event/task as they plan it
For instance, students will be able to log all their assignments with their due date and then choose when to be reminded prior to the deadline and then check it off upon completion. Students will be able to stay up to date with everything that is due and make sure to never miss a deadline again.
For immediate release, the application should be able to store tasks and remind the user on a specific time/date and have the ability to check it off your list. The user can create multiple tasks and set reminders with alerts & notifications.
